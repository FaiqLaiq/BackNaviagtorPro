# BackNavigatorPro (Unity)
<h2>Problem:</h2>
	We usually come across the situation in which we have to implement escape functionality in our game so that our screens closes sequencially when we press escape on them. For example; I am in <b>Main Menu</b> of my game, from there I've opened <b>Settings Menu</b>, from there I have open <b>Instructions</b> pop up. Now, if I press back button, the <b>Instructions</b> pop up should close itself on first place, Then on next back button <b>Settings Menu</b> should close itself next. And at last, on pressing back button from <b>Main Menu</b> I should be able to quit the game.

<h2>Solution:</h2>
	Just import this package in unity. Follow the instructions given in documentation folder (BackNavigatorPro/Documentation/BNP Documentatoin), and we are good to go. It will take less than 2 minutes to implement this package.
