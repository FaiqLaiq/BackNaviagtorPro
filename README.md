# BackNaviagtorPro (Unity)

Problem:
	We usually come across the situation in which we have to implement escape functionality in our game so that our screens closes sequencially when we press escape on them. For example; I am in Main Menu of my game, from there I've opened Settings Menu, from there I have open Instructions pop up. Now, if I press back button, the Instructions pop up should close itself on first place, Then on next back button Settings Menu should close itself next. And at last, on pressing back button from Main Menu I should be able to quit the game.

Solution:
	Just import this package in unity. Follow the instructions given in documentation folder (BackNavigatorPro/Documentation/BNP Documentatoin).
